**About the format of the file:** Each row is formatted as [User ID] [Item ID] [Rating]

***Note that the ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00. As of May 2009, the jokes {7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} are the "gauge set" (as discussed in the Eigentaste paper) and the jokes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20, 27, 31, 43, 51, 52, 61, 73, 80, 100, 116} have been removed (i.e. they are never displayed or rated).***
